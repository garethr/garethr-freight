[Freight](https://github.com/rcrowley/freight) is a rather nifty tool
for maintaining a Debian package repository.

This Puppet module installs the freight package from a third party
repository. It relies on the puppetlabs apt module.

## Credits

All the credit should go to
[rcrowley](https://github.com/rcrowley/freight) who wrote Freight. I just
wrapped that in a puppet module.
